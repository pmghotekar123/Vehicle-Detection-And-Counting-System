# Vehicle Detection and Counting System

## Overview

The Vehicle Detection and Counting System is a software application designed to identify and count vehicles in images or video streams. This system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track vehicles, providing valuable information for traffic monitoring, surveillance, and analysis.

## Features

1. **Vehicle Detection:** The system employs advanced computer vision algorithms to detect vehicles in images or video frames.

2. **Vehicle Tracking:** Once detected, vehicles are tracked across consecutive frames to monitor their movement and trajectory.

3. **Counting Functionality:** The system accurately counts the number of vehicles passing through a specified area, helping in traffic analysis and management.

4. **Real-time Processing:** The application supports real-time processing, allowing for immediate monitoring and analysis of live video streams.
